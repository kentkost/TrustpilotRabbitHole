Traps?
  One word has a capital Å(Ångstrom)
   Possible watch out for accents and capital letters?
   Ångstrom is not part of the anagram though.
    Most likely TrustPilots word crawler at works. (after normalization) Only include that doesn't start with[A-Z](65->90) but Å is 197
  
  garlic and garlic's exists so does garments and garment's. Which means not all letters ending with 's has an equivalent 
  word partner that just ends with s.
    Important because hat means we can't ignore ' 
    Important because we don't want to find anagrams for both words.
    Just have hashset? and swap words when checking if anagram corresponds to hash?
  
  The only special characters are ', 

todo:
  Make checking permutations and hashes a separate thread (low)
  Generate unique permutations only (low)
